- Results in smaller, faster and more efficient products;
- Priorities content over aesthetic design, which may be desirable.

**Mobile-First Cons** 

- The desktop version might feel over empty and simple;
- More difficult and counter-intuitive to develop;
- Less creative freedom, mkaing it more difficult to create distinctive products;
- Clients are use to seeing the desktop version of the site as a prototype.

##### **What are responsive images?**

The goal of responsive images is to server the right image to the right screen size and device, in order to avoid downloading unnecessary large images on smaller screens.

Responsive images is not only good for responsive design, but also good for web performance and help to promote maintainable and scalable code.

##### **When to use responsive images?**

Here some use cases:

**Resolution-switching** - this is decreasing the image size on smaller screens with a smaller resolution.

**Density-switching** - this is serving an image to a higher resolution screen and a smaller resolution for smaller screens.

**Art-Direction** - this is serving a different image on smaller screens.

- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)
    - This was used to style the HTML document.

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
    - This was used to style the HTML document. Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - This is a version control system which I used to handle my project throughout the development stages, to save and push my work from gitpod to github.

- [Github](http://github.com/)
    - This was used to store my project after it was saved and pushed from gitpod.

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - This was used for the interactivity, behaviors of the web.

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - This was used for the interactivity, behaviors of the web.
- [Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX)
    - Ajax can be used to create single-page apps, in which the entire web app consists of a single document, which uses Ajax to update its content as needed.

- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
    - This was used to deploy this application.

- [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)
    - Heroku Postgres is a managed SQL database service provided directly by Heroku.


- [Google Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
    - This was one of the most used tool throughout the development of this project, as it can be used for tasks like testing, debugging and showing where elements are positioned on the web page.
